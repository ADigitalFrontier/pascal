# This program studies the digital roots of the center "column" of Pascal's triangle, i.e: [1, 2, 6, 20, 70, 252, 924, etc..].
# From a simple hand-written observation it seems that the digital root of each center element is either 3, 6, or 9, or follows
# the following property: If the digital root of the element is not 9, then for each element on the left and on the right of the
# element, add its digital root to the elements digital root, and continue left and right until a 3, 6, or 9 is reached. Do not
# add the 3, 6, or 9 boundary elements. This grouping of non-369 elements seems to always yield a digital root of either 3 6 or 9.
# This program verifies my hand-written observations with thousands of additional, programmatically generated examples, which seem
# to indicate that this property likely holds for any number of rows. Additionally, it seems that this sequence converges to repeating
# 9s as it increases in length.
